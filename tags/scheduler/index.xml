      <description>Previously, I wrote about the basics of testing with RxBlocking in Testing with RxBlocking, part1.
Since then, I presented 2 times at meetups about MVVM and RxBlocking and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post few more examples in a broader context.
But first a question I got several times already when discussing RxBlocking.
When to use RxBlocking vs. RxTest? RxTest is a great library for testing RxSwift code. It offers everything you need to test your Rx code and in most cases it&amp;rsquo;ll be everything you need.</description>

      <description>Whenever you decide to test your Rx code you have not one but two excellent choices - RxTest and RxBlocking.
In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll go over the RxBlocking API and explain shortly how does the libary work. In Part 2 I&amp;rsquo;ll go over a bunch of real-life examples from open source I&amp;rsquo;ve written.

      <description>Cross-thread subscriptions is a question that seems to pop up again and again on the RxSwift Slack channel. The explanation is very simple so I thought it was a good idea to put it in a blog post so whenever needed I can link to it instead of typing everything again and again.
Observable subscriptions The terminology in regard to subscribing and observing is imho a bit messy so let&amp;rsquo;s first take this out of the way (do not skip this section!</description>
