      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly happy to share that today the new raywenderlich.com book &amp;ldquo;Modern Concurrency in Swift&amp;rdquo;, that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, is available at www.swiftconcurrencybook.com!
Together with editors Sandra Grauschopf, Felipe Laso-Marsetti, Richard Turton, and Shai Mishali, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working very hard to get a book out as soon as possible on the newly released in 2021 Swift Concurrency:
The book is written in the classic raywenderlich.com style that mixes key pieces of theory with step-by-step instructions, guiding the readers through working on practical, real-life projects.</description>

      <title>First update to the RxSwift book with version 1.1</title>

      <description>This is a short update about the first update to our RxSwift book.
First of all, we&amp;rsquo;d like to thank all of you who posted to our book errata forum! (and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t hit the forums yet, check &amp;lsquo;em out - it&amp;rsquo;s the best place to report typos, bugs, and more: https://forums.raywenderlich.com/c/books/rxswift ).
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with the raywenderlich.com team on a number of books and I must say the RxSwift book has had, so far, the most enthusiastic feedback - we&amp;rsquo;ve been drowned in questions, thank you messages, and typo/bugs reports.</description>

      <title>Two free chapters from the RxSwift book!</title>

      <description>Last week we announced our brand new RxSwift book (available now)!
The book starts with the very basics in Chapter 1, &amp;ldquo;Hello, world!&amp;rdquo; and leads the reader through a plethora of topics all the way to Chapter 23, &amp;ldquo;MVVM&amp;rdquo; and Chapter 24, &amp;ldquo;Building a complete app with RxSwift&amp;rdquo;.
Being so detailed about RxSwift knowledge already sets the book apart as a great learning source, but what is really special is that it&amp;rsquo;s written by four very active RxSwift community memebers and it&amp;rsquo;s polished by two more editors.</description>

      <description>After a long time working on this project, I and my friends and colleagues Florent Pillet, Junior Bontognali, Scott Gardner, Ash Furrow, Chris Belanger, and Ray and Vicki Wenderlich are happy to announce that our new book about development with RxSwift is available now!
How it came to be? When I first tried out RxSwift (being excited about it by some of the same people who are my co-authors on the book) I immediately noticed that even though there is plenty of information on the Internet, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a single structured resource where people can learn systematically.</description>
