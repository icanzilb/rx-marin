      <description>Intro Just like when learning a new language you need to build up a dictionary to start understanding how the language works, you got to learn the Rx operators and everything will eventually click together.
And then once you have a good common of a language it&amp;rsquo;s okay to start coming up with new words too to boost the expressiveness of your speech and for convenience.
Same thing happened with me last week - for the first time I felt like I&amp;rsquo;m getting work done with RxSwift because I had good understanding how to use at least few operators.</description>
