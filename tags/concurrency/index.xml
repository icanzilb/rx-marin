      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly happy to share that today the new raywenderlich.com book &amp;ldquo;Modern Concurrency in Swift&amp;rdquo;, that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, is available at www.swiftconcurrencybook.com!
Together with editors Sandra Grauschopf, Felipe Laso-Marsetti, Richard Turton, and Shai Mishali, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working very hard to get a book out as soon as possible on the newly released in 2021 Swift Concurrency:
The book is written in the classic raywenderlich.com style that mixes key pieces of theory with step-by-step instructions, guiding the readers through working on practical, real-life projects.</description>
