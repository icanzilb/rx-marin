      <description>This year is the 5th edition of NSSpain - the only international iOS/macOS conference in Spain and one of the best in the world I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. There are many reasons why I think NSSpain is the right way to do a conference, including but not limited to - single track, remote location, and best-in-business speakers&amp;hellip; (And that&amp;rsquo;s why last year I sponsored a student-ticket to NSSpain.)
Speakers receive not only free entry to the full conference and free accomodation, but also tons of love from the organizers.</description>

      <description>This is a short update about the first update to our RxSwift book.
First of all, we&amp;rsquo;d like to thank all of you who posted to our book errata forum! (and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t hit the forums yet, check &amp;lsquo;em out - it&amp;rsquo;s the best place to report typos, bugs, and more: https://forums.raywenderlich.com/c/books/rxswift ).
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with the raywenderlich.com team on a number of books and I must say the RxSwift book has had, so far, the most enthusiastic feedback - we&amp;rsquo;ve been drowned in questions, thank you messages, and typo/bugs reports.</description>

      <title>Two free chapters from the RxSwift book!</title>

      <description>Last week we announced our brand new RxSwift book (available now)!
The book starts with the very basics in Chapter 1, &amp;ldquo;Hello, world!&amp;rdquo; and leads the reader through a plethora of topics all the way to Chapter 23, &amp;ldquo;MVVM&amp;rdquo; and Chapter 24, &amp;ldquo;Building a complete app with RxSwift&amp;rdquo;.
Being so detailed about RxSwift knowledge already sets the book apart as a great learning source, but what is really special is that it&amp;rsquo;s written by four very active RxSwift community memebers and it&amp;rsquo;s polished by two more editors.</description>

      <description>After a long time working on this project, I and my friends and colleagues Florent Pillet, Junior Bontognali, Scott Gardner, Ash Furrow, Chris Belanger, and Ray and Vicki Wenderlich are happy to announce that our new book about development with RxSwift is available now!
How it came to be? When I first tried out RxSwift (being excited about it by some of the same people who are my co-authors on the book) I immediately noticed that even though there is plenty of information on the Internet, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a single structured resource where people can learn systematically.</description>
